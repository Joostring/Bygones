  m_text: "Tragedy strikes small town as young boy falls to his death in well\r\nApril
    20, 1980\r\n\r\nThe small town of Little Grove is grieving from a heartbreaking
    tragedy after 8-year-old Oliver \u201COllie\u201D D. fell to his death in an
    abandoned well located on his family\u2019s property this Wednesday. The incident
    has left the community in shock, mourning the loss of a boy described by neighbours
    as kind-hearted, adventurous and full of life. \r\n\r\nThe authorities have yet
    to release much information about how the incident came about, but are saying
    that by the time rescue teams arrived at the scene, it was already too late.
    The news of the boys passing sent ripples of sorrow throughout Little Grove,
    where Ollie was known and loved by many. \r\n\r\n\u201CHe was the sweetest kid
    I\u2019d ever met\u201D, said Mrs. Mary Gould, a longtime neighbor and friend
    of the boy\u2019s family. \u201CHe was always polite, always smiling. He would
    often come by my house and help me take care of my cats and feed them. I just
    can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone.\u201D\r\n\r\nLittle Grove Elementary School,
    where Ollie was a student, held a moment of silence in his honor. \u201CHe was
    a bright young boy with a love for learning and a heart full of kindness\u201D,
    said his teacher, Mr. Brian Finley. \u201CHis absence is already deeply felt
    in our classroom.\u201D\r\n\r\nDespite the outpouring grief from the community,
    Ollie\u2019s family have yet to comment on the incident and have declined to
    speak with the press or anyone but the police. And it seems the community is
    honoring their request for privacy during this painful time as many of the townsfolk
    sympathize with the family.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think we all understand that they\u2019re
    hurting\u201D, said local store owner Frank Jacobs. \u201CNo parent should have
    to go through something like this. All we can do is respect their wishes and
    offer our support however we can.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs the town mourns, there have
    been renewed discussions about safety concerns regarding old wells and other
    neglected structures in and around Little Grove. Mayor Richard\u2026\r\n\n\n\n"
